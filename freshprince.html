		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

		<p>From western Philadelphia I hail <br />
			<font id="blue"> where </font> <font id="green">in</font> my youth I<font id="green">'d play upon the green <br />
			'</font>til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd <br />
			<font id="green">by ruffians contemptible and mean. <br />
			Although the spat was trivial and brief, <br />
			it wounded my dear mother deep within; <br />
			and so, to give her conscience sweet relief, <br />
			she sent me forth to live amongst her kin. <br />
			When to my port of call I'd been conveyed, <br /></font>
			I came upon a coachman most unique; <br />
			and yet, I simply took the trip and paid, <br />
			despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique. <br />
			<font id="green">I survey all the land with princely mien <br />
			in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</font></p>
